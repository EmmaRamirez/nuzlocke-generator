This is a beta. Expect everything to break. Save backups if you value them.

## A Preview

## Running Locally

In order to run this application locally, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). After installing those, start by opening the command prompt and running the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator.git
cd nuzlocke-generator
npm install
npm run serve
```

Note: closing the command prompt will stop the server!

You can also click the `Clone or Download` button and select to download it as a zip file. You'll then want to use the `cd` command to navigate to the nuzlocke-generator folder. I'm available on Discord (emma#4085) or through Github issues if you have any questions.

You should find it at `localhost:8080`. In order to check for updates, run the following

```bash
git pull origin master
```

And then re-run the server!

- Record your nuzlocke with a flashy image

If you have ideas for features of fixes, please tell me! I want to make this app as useful as possible.
