# Limited Beta
This is a limited beta of the application. As such, it has a shitload of bugs everywhere. Some key things to note are:

- Data _is_ saved automatically, but be sure to export data into a file often
- Data is saved via localStorage, so you may not be able to view your saved data on a different device, browser, or in incognito mode
- Images for Pokemon may not be present
- Some editor & styling options may not work
- Custom regions don't work yet
- Custom CSS is messy

# Contributing

- You can comment, request new features, or file bugs [here](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator/issues)
- Right now, the biggest needs are images for Pokémon and finding bugs
- If you complete your nuzlocke & document it using this, send me the final data so I can add it to a Hall of Fame!

## Nuzlocke Generator Post-Mortem
If you've been using this app, you may have noticed that it went down for a sustained period time. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have caused. The root issue of this problem had to do with Heroku (the service provider for this application) changing how builds work&dash;the source code was built locally and then deployed statically to Heroku beforehand. After investigation and solving this issue, I also dealt with a slug size error by compressing all Pokémon images.

So what does this mean for you?
- You should not expect anymore downtime like this in the future. This was a one-off ocurrence that is now fixed.
- I've set up more proactive alerts for the application if this ever happens again
- Many users have been running the app locally (check https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator for instructions)
    - Please note that this will require you to update manually whenever I push updates
- I am also investigating both switching providers and creating a stand-alone Desktop version of the app
- Please feel free to use the bug reporter to send any feature requests you may have

Thank you!
